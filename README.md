## Why would I use this?

This library is not meant to be used in isolation, rather it's purpose is to serve as a bridge language between a few different packages that address different aspects of networking on apple platforms.

## Installation

If you're working directly in a Package, add `RNP` to your Package.swift file

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/JARMourato/RNP.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
]
```

If working in an Xcode project select `File->Add Packages...` and search for the package name: `RNP` or the git url:

`https://github.com/JARMourato/RNP.git`
